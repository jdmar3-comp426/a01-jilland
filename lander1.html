            <h1>UFO Crash / Aliens</h1>

            <h3>Proven True - Exists in Game</h3>
            <p>The existence of Aliens within the Fallout universe is a proven myth explored in Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 4. 
                Their species is known as the Zetans and are hostile towards the Player if approached. In Fallout 4, an Alien ship crashes in the Commonwealth. 
                This event occurs randomly within the game, however if the Player approaches the crash site they will find a nearby cave with an injured (and aggressive) alien inside. 
                No items can be taken from the crash site except for the weaponry on the Alien in the cave. </p>
