            <h3>Proven True - Exists in Game</h3>
            <p>Originally a pre-war myth to discourage misbehavior from children, the Pint-Sized Slasher became proven within the Trainquility Lane quest in Fallout 3 at the hands of the Player. 
                The Pint-Sized Slasher was a story of a child serial killer who wore a clown mask and became a popular halloween costume in the Fallout Universe 21st century. 
                However, during one mission in Fallout 3, the player can choose to pose as this killer and eliminate residents of a small cul-de-sac during the quest. 
                This myth is later referenced in Fallout 4 with a child dressed similar to the Pint-Size Slasher shown running to the Vault alongside the player at the start of the game.</p>
