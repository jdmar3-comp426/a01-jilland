        <h1>Deathclaw Sanctuary</h1>
        <h3>Proven True - Exists in Game</h3>
        <p>Within Fallout 3, the myth of the Deathclaw Sanctuary has been proven. Deathclaws, one of the most notable enemies within the Fallout series, are typically seen individually throughout the game, but the myth of a nest/sanctuary of a herd of them can be found between a Broadcast Tower and Chapel within the Fallout 3 map. The Sanctuary is a dark cave maze with various skeletons from others taken by Deathclaws. If the player clears the cave, they can recieve an Endurance Bobblehead for their bravery and skill in outrunning the most dangerous creatures within the game.</p>
