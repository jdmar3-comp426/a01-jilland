            <h3>Proven False - Just a Myth</h3>
            <p>An unproven/false myth from the Fallout Universe is the existence of the Numbers Station- a strange radio station that is rumored to predict the future. 
                It began as a creepypasta, detailing that a player killed the host of the Galaxy News Radio Station in Fallout 3, and then began experiencing issues with the radio playing in the game. 
                Rather than the typical old-timey music, lines of code would be played instead that were decoded to be predictions of real world events, some of which came true.
                Due to the original "Numbers Station" stories from the Cold War and the context of the Fallout Games referencing the Cold War/Nuclear Winter, players believed the myth despite its false origins. </p>
